## try projecy inside dist folder
In order to try the project inside the 'dist' folder make sure you have installed http-serve globally -> 'npm install http-server -g', then inside the project directory (in the terminal) run
http-server dist/[your-project-name]. Now you can visit http://localhost:8080/index.html to view the application
